# Random Survival
**Move/jump with WASD/Spacebar.  Use the mouse to aim; LMB for melee attack, RMB for ranged.**

For this final assignment, we were asked to create a unique gameplay mechanic, but the professor let me focus more on systems design.  This game uses Perlin noise to generate biosphere info for each tile.  Object pooling is used to recycle tiles & enemies when the player gets far enough away.
